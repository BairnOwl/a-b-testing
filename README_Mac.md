1. Signup for a free heroku account here - https://signup.heroku.com/
    Choose primary development language as Python while signing up.
    Don't forget the user name and  password. You will need it
    throughout this assignment.

2.   We have to install heroku CLI(Command Line Interface).
     As CLI is part of toolkit, we will now install toolkit.

      Run the following on iterm/terminal.

     Install brew if not installed -
     /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

     Install heroku toolkit. CLI is part of toolkit.

     brew install heroku-toolbelt

3. Open a terminal on Mac.

4. Goto a folder where you have to download your a-b-testing folder.

5. cd a-b-testing

6. heroku login

   Use the email/password you used for signing up in step 1 above.

7. heroku create
  This should output something similar to this.

  Creating app... done, â¬¢ <randomappname>
  https://<randomappname>.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/<randomappname>.git

8.  git commit -am "<Commit message>"

9.   git push heroku master
    For the first time, it might take some time. Subsequent runs would be little faster.
    At the very end, it would output a heroku app link, which can be opened in a browser.

    For the first time, you will just create app with stencil code provided in Step 4.
    For the purpose of A/B testing assignment, we want you to modify B.html in this
    stencil code and we want you to run commands from this step(step 8), to push/host your
    changes.

10. heroku open
    This should open the sample app in chrome automatically. If it does not open, you can
    try opening the link manually.

For any doubts or to debug issues about heroku, you can read more here..
